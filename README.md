# cards
A card triage page with Angular


See instructions

Remarks:
- I did that in 4.5 hours
- I am using bootstrap
     - bootstrap is helpful and simple for designing something clean at low cost and with documentation! I think documentation is my main reason to use bootstrap. A team can work with the same look and feel with a good documentation.
     - I used flex - was not really needed there - I am just used to it - same reason, it is clean and documented
- I am using sass
    - Mainly for the colors and fonts. I do not do a project anymore without a centralized source for colors and font to have consistency in the all project.
- I am not sure about the filter feature: in the instructions, it is patient name AND arrythmias. The arrow in the mockup seems to suggest a choice. I did a search on string on both. Perhaps a second version of the instructions ;-). This choice does not scaled. In a real project I will do something like typeahead.
- My own feedback: I could have fix all of these points with more time
   - My design is not sexy - just bootstrap... I wanted to do an accordeon on the done column - with by default all close. Because in a done column we do not need the details.
   - I did not do the error handling in the service. oops
   - I never wrote unittests with angular. I would like to learn.
   - Missing overflow: hidden on both columns.
   - I did not feel like the need to put css animations. No enough data and features
   - I lost time with setting a new project. I do not set a new project very often! 
   - Otherwise, I think I did all the requirements. I like typescript, so it was not a problem for me.
Conclusion: it was fun. Angular is fun to work with.
